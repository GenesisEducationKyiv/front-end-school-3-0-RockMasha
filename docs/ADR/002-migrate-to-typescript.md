# ADR 002: migrate to TypeScript

## Context

Currently, I've heard a lot about the advantages of TypeScript and now want to practice using it for educational purposes.

## Decision

Migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Rationale

TypeScript provides static typing, which helps catch errors before runtime;  
it improves autocomplete and refactoring, makes the code more understandable and self-documented, and facilitates scalability.

## Future Consequences

**Positive consequences:**
- The code will become more readable.
- Improved scalability and easier debugging.

**Negative consequences:**
- Requires additional time to write types.
- Increases code volume.

## Status `Accepted`

## Consequences After Execution

Detecting errors has become easier thanks to types, writing code has become easier thanks to TypeScript hints.
