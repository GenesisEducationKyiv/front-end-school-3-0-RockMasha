# ADR N: Redesign to a More User-Centered Interface

## Context

When showing the player to my friends, I received a lot of feedback regarding the design.

## Decision

Modernize the player’s design by:

- Changing the color scheme
- Improving form styling
- Updating button icons

## Rationale

A better design enhances user experience.

Reducing the number of colors allows users to focus more easily on the main content—an excessive palette can be distracting or create visual noise.  
Updating form styles, especially inputs (removing outlines and backgrounds, increasing padding), will make them more aesthetically pleasing.  
Updating the icons will give the player a more modern look.

## Future Consequences

**Positive consequences:**

- Improved user experience

**Negative consequences:**

- Additional time will be needed to implement the new design

## Status `Proposed`

## Consequences After Execution

The decision on implementation has not yet been made.
